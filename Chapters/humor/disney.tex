\section{Motion Modelling}

Next, we took what we learned from the HuMoR investigation, notably \TODO{What did we learn?} and moved on to the Disney Research|Studios codebase, with a view of implementing a number of motion models tailored to fit with the existing system, and training these models on the available Disney Research|Studios data.
