In Chapter \ref{chpt:humor}., we came to the conclusion that the next sensible step would be an investigation of a model that operates directly on motion sequences. We also desired to have a general model that can be used for many different tasks, such that we might get a better overview of the uses of motion modelling. We therefore decided, due to promising literature presented in Section \ref{sec:related_diffusion}, that diffusion models were worth investigating.
