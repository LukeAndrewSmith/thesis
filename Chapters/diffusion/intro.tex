In Chapter \ref{chpt:humor}., we came to the conclusion that the next sensible step would be an investigation of a model that operates directly on motion sequences. We also had a growing desire to find a more general model that could more easily be used for a variety of different tasks, such that we might get a better overview of the uses of motion modelling and potentially find new avenues to explore that we had not yet thought of. It therefore decided that, due to the promising literature presented in Section \ref{sec:related_diffusion}, diffusion models represented the most interesting direction to pursue.
