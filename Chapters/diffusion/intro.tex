In Chapter \ref{chpt:humor}., we concluded that the next sensible step would be to investigate a model that operates directly on motion sequences. We also had a growing desire to find a more general model that could readily be used for a wider variety of different tasks, such that we might gain insight into the broader uses of motion modeling and find unexplored avenues. It was therefore decided that, due to the promising literature presented in Section \ref{sec:related_diffusion}, diffusion models represented the most interesting direction to pursue.
