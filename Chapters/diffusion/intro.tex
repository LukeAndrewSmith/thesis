In Chapter \ref{chpt:humor} we concluded that the next sensible step would be to investigate a model that operates directly on motion sequences. We wished next to investigate a general-purpose motion generation model that could be readily employed in a wide variety of tasks such that we might gain insight into the broader uses of motion modeling and find unexplored avenues. Due to the promising literature presented in Section \ref{sec:related_diffusion}, it was decided that diffusion models operating on motion sequences represented a research direction worth pursuing.
