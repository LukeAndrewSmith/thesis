\section{Conclusion}

The DMD diffusion framework described in \secref{sec:disney_motion_diffusion} proves to represent an exciting research direction. The baseline model shows good performance on a variety of tasks, as seen in \secref{sec:baseline_evaluation}, demonstrating that the diffusion framework is able to learn a general purpose motion prior model without task specific fine tuning or architeture design. This gives us hope for future research directions in which the specific task to solve is more precisely described, where more fine grained architecture, data and training choices could be made that could further improve the performance of the models. 

The implementation of the diffusion framework within the Disney Research|Studios codebase paves the way for further investigation into it's uses in the context of general animation tasks.
